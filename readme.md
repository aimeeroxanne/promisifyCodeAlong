#### Javascript Promises Code Along by [Craig Quincy](https://github.com/craigquincy)

The goal of this code along is to introduce the concept of Javascript Promises and recap on top level coding violations. It is meant to be coded from scratch, with no base repo.

**Top Level coding violations made in this repo**</br>
- DRY - Don't repeat yourself
- Hard coding data
- SRP - Single Responsibility Principle 
- Callback hell 

**Topics to highlight:**</br>
Blocking vs. NonBlocking

**Final check for understanding**</br> 
You are doing a phone interview with a company you really want to work for. So... what's the deal with Promises? 

**Buzz words to look for:**</br>
asynchronous, non blocking, error handling, readability, resolve and reject
